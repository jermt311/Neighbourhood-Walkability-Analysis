# Neighbourhood Walkability Analysis

## Project Introduction
In this project, several datasets were gathered to perform data anlaysis of walkability of different neighbourhoods in Sydney.

## Data Set Description and Preperation

Tha aim of this project is to calculate the `walkability score` for different neighbourhoods in Sydney similar to the 'WalkScore' service (https://www.walkscore.com/AU-NSW/Sydney). Walkability is commanly expressed as a measure of density, diversity, design, destination accessibility and distance to transport. <br / >

To calculate this score, we will be integrating different data sources and based on the computed walkability scores, perform a correlation analysis with the median income and the average monthly rent per naighbourhood according to the provided Census Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
